- Showing cookies at the console (if _httpOnly_ is false): `document.cookie`
- JWT Signing:
  - **Headers**: Tells the server what type of signature is being used (meta)
  - **Payload**: Used to indetify the user (e.g. contains user id)
  - **Signature**: Makes the token secure (like a stamp of autheticity)
